# `SHOW` statement

The `SHOW` statement can be used to replay changes made to a table.

## Requirements
- You must first [`DEFINE`](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/define/table#example-usage) a [Change Feed](https://surrealdb.com/cf).

### Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
SHOW CHANGES FOR TABLE @tableName [SINCE "@timestamp"] [LIMIT @number]
```

## Example usage
### Basic usage

The following expression shows usage of the SHOW statement.

```surql
-- Define the change feed and its duration
DEFINE TABLE reading CHANGEFEED 3d;

-- Create some records in the reading table
CREATE reading SET story = "Once upon a time";
CREATE reading SET story = "there was a database";

-- Replay changes to the reading table
SHOW CHANGES FOR TABLE reading SINCE "2023-09-07T01:23:52Z" LIMIT 10;
```

```bash title="Response"
[
    {
        "changes": [
            {
                "define_table": {
                    "name": "reading"
                }
            }
        ],
        "versionstamp": 29
    },
    {
        "changes": [
            {
                "update": {
                    "id": "reading:h1gcbc7ykbpslellh2g2",
                    "story": "Once upon a time"
                }
            }
        ],
        "versionstamp": 30
    },
    {
        "changes": [
            {
                "update": {
                    "id": "reading:l9qfcncklhnlklby1avf",
                    "story": "there was a database"
                }
            }
        ],
        "versionstamp": 31
    }
]
```

:::note
__Note:__ `SINCE <time>` needs to be after the time the `CHANGEFEED` was defined. Also, when defining a `CHANGEFEED` on a table, it implicitly creates a `CHANGEFEED` on the database.
